# Repo details

This repo contains my work for the Artificial Intelligence (COMP3702) course at the University of Queensland.
In my taking of this course Dr. Alina Bialkowski was the course coordinator, and Nicholas Collins wrote most
of the supporting code. Most if not all edits made to these supporting codes by me happens in the solution.py file.

Peter Bohm wrote the code and slides in subdirectories of tutorial_work.

# Running the code

A conda environment was made containing all required libraries, not tested exhaustively will add as needed, this can
be installed using

`conda env create -f environment`

then run the code after activating the environment

conda activate 3702-env
python file-to-run.py
